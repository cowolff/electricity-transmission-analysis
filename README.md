# Electricity Transmission Analysis

This repository contains analysis and visualization tools for exploring electricity transmission networks, with a focus on their privatization. To perform this analysis, I relied on GPT-5 for analyzing the situation, while forcing it to use web-search, so that the answers are grounded in real-world data and not just hallucinated.

## Overview

The project provides Jupyter notebooks and data files to:
- Analyze electricity transmission data
- Visualize transmission networks on maps
- Assess the effects of privatization on transmission infrastructure

## Contents

- `analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook for data analysis using GPT based web-search for automation.
- `map.ipynb`: Notebook for visualizing transmission networks and geographic data.
- `privatisation_results.json`: Results and data related to privatization analysis.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/cowolff/electricity-transmission-analysis
   cd electricity-transmission-analysis
   ```
2. Open the notebooks (`analysis.ipynb` and `map.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Install required Python packages (see below).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- Recommended packages (install via pip):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - geopandas

Install packages:
```zsh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib geopandas
```

## Usage

- Run `analysis.ipynb` to perform data analysis.
- Run `map.ipynb` to visualize transmission networks and geographic data.
- Use `privatisation_results.json` for additional data and results.
